  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * libxcb1-dev needs a dependency on libpthread-stubs0-dev and versioned

libxcb (1.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * The "Thanksgiving" release: We feel thankful to have it released.
  * Bump versioned Build-Depends on xcb-proto to 1.0, to match configure.ac.
  * Add version to Build-Depends on check, requiring 0.9.4-2 or newer, when
    check first started shipping the pkg-config file.
  * Add Build-Depends on libpthread-stubs0-dev.  Use a versioned
    Build-Depends, to help buildds find it in experimental.
  * Add version to Build-Depends on xsltproc, requiring 1.1.19-1 or newer, to
    get the fix for bug 398327.
  * Add XS-Vcs-Git field.
  * Cherry-pick post-1.0 changes from master:
    * "NetBSD doesn't have AI_ADDRCONFIG: use it only if it's available."
    * "Use substitition variables in xcb-xinerama.pc.in, not instances of their
       values"
  * Add new library, -dev, and -dbg packages for libxcb-xinerama.
  * Install pkg-config files to /usr/lib/pkgconfig, not
    /usr/share/pkgconfig.

libxcb (0.9.92-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.

  [ Josh Triplett ]
  * No longer installs files to /usr/include/X11, so remove Pre-Depends on
    x11-common.
  * Update to Standards-Version 3.7.2 (no changes required).
  * Point specifically to http://xcb.freedesktop.org/dist in copyright file,
    rather than http://xcb.freedesktop.org .
  * Add debian/watch file.
  * Install pkgconfig files to /usr/share/pkgconfig.
  * Version Build-Depends on xcb-proto as (>= 0.9.92)
  * Change libxcb0{,-dev,-dbg} to libxcb1{,-dev,-dbg} to match soname bump, and
    update Depends of other library -dev packages.
  * Add debian/control stanzas and debhelper install files for new library
    libxcb-xlib0.
  * Change libxcb${ext}0{,-dev,-dbg} to libxcb-${ext}0{,-dev,-dbg}, to match
    the sonames of the libraries.
  * cdbs >= 0.4.40 now builds -dbg packages for each library package, without
    requiring DEB_DBG_PACKAGE_libxcb* for each one.  Remove assignments to
    these variables in debian/rules, and version cdbs Build-Depends accordingly.
  * Change -dbg package priorities from optional to extra.

libxcb (0.9-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Stop running autoreconf in debian/rules, and remove Build-Depends for
    autoconf, automake, and libtool.
  * Update -dbg package handling to work with debhelper compat level 5.
    Increase minimum version on debhelper Build-Depends to 5.0.0.
  * Stop installing the libtool .la files.
  * Add Build-Depends on libxdmcp-dev.
  * Debian X11R7 transition:
    * Change Depends and Build-Depends on x-dev to x11proto-core-dev.
    * Install headers to /usr/include/X11, not /usr/X11R6/include/X11.
    * Pre-Depends: x11-common (>= 1:1.09).
  * Create library, -dev, and -dbg packages for each new extension library.
  * Drop library version from source package name.
  * Add a Section field for the source package in debian/control.
  * Set DEB_MAKE_CHECK_TARGET=check in debian/rules.
  * Stop setting DEB_CONFIGURE_EXTRA_FLAGS = --with-opt in debian/rules;
    cdbs does the right thing on its own, and correctly handles
    DEB_BUILD_OPTS.
  * Work around the unsetting of CFLAGS in src/Makefile.am, by passing CFLAGS
    to make via DEB_MAKE_INVOKE in debian/rules.
  * Remove Bugs field in control, so bugs go to the Debian BTS.
  * Set distribution to experimental.
